## Summary

Briefly describe the feature or improvement you’re proposing.

## Motivation

- What problem does this solve for maintainers or new contributors?
- How does it improve onboarding (env/deps/run/test, not deep architecture)?

## Proposed behavior

Describe what you’d expect the MCP server to do, ideally in terms of:

- Changes/additions to `RepoAnalysis` fields.
- New or improved MCP tools (if any).
- Concrete examples (input repo → desired output).

## Out of scope check

This feature does **not** try to:

- Replace deep code comprehension or tools like DeepWiki.
- Infer org/team policies (pre‑commit, CI, code review rules).
- Execute project code or call external services.

If it might touch any of these, please explain how you see the boundaries.

## Additional context

Links to example repos, prior work, or related issues.
