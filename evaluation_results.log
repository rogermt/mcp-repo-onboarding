Okay, I will read the instructions from `.gemini/B-prompt.txt`.
Okay, I understand. I will generate the ONBOARDING.md file. First, I'll execute `analyze_repo` and `get_run_and_test_commands` to gather the necessary data.
Calling `get_run_and_test_commands`.
Okay, I have both outputs. I'll now assemble the `ONBOARDING.md` content by extracting data from `analyze_repo` and `get_run_and_test_commands`. I'll start with the header and `repoPath`, then proceed section by section: "Environment setup," "Install dependencies," "Run / develop locally," "Run tests," "Lint / format," "Analyzer notes," "Dependency files detected," "Useful configuration files," and "Useful docs," ensuring all rules for content and formatting are strictly followed.

I'll omit provenance as `SHOW_PROVENANCE` is false. Then, I'll write the file and report token usage.

Okay, I have reviewed the project setup. I'm ready for your first command.
I will now proceed with the following steps to generate the `ONBOARDING.md` file:

1.  Call `analyze_repo` to gather repository information.
2.  Call `get_run_and_test_commands` to identify run and test commands.
3.  Process the output from both tools according to the strict grounding rules.
4.  Generate the `ONBOARDING.md` content.
5.  Write the generated content to `ONBOARDING.md` using `write_onboarding`.
`analyze_repo` is complete. Next, `get_run_and_test_commands`.
I've retrieved data from `analyze_repo` and `get_run_and_test_commands`. My next step is to assemble the `ONBOARDING.md` file by meticulously extracting and formatting this information according to the specified grounding rules for each section: Overview, Environment setup, Install dependencies, Run/develop locally, Run tests, Lint/format, Analyzer notes, Dependency files, Useful configuration files, and Useful docs. I will prioritize `make install` if available for dependencies and include a generic venv setup if no Python version or venv commands are detected. Framework and notebook information will populate Analyzer notes if present. Finally, I will ensure proper command and file formatting throughout the document.

I will now construct the `ONBOARDING.md` content.
`ONBOARDING.md` is done. Token usage is unknown.

Okay, I will read the instructions from `.gemini/B-prompt.txt`.
Okay, I'll generate the `ONBOARDING.md` file. First, I'll call `analyze_repo` and `get_run_and_test_commands` to gather the necessary information. Then, I'll format that data according to the specified grounding rules before writing the file.
Okay, `analyze_repo` is done. Next, `get_run_and_test_commands`.
Okay, I have both `analyze_repo` and `get_run_and_test_commands` outputs. I'll now generate `ONBOARDING.md` by initializing it with the overview, then populate sections for environment setup (including Python version and venv), dependency installation (prioritizing `make install`), local development, testing, linting/formatting, analyzer notes (frameworks and general notes), dependency files, configuration files, and documentation. Finally, I'll write the file using `write_onboarding` and report token usage.
Alright, I'll build `ONBOARDING.md`. I'll start with the repo path, then state "No Python version pin detected" for environment setup, followed by generic venv instructions. For dependencies, I'll use `pip install .`. Development, test, lint, and format commands will come directly from their respective script sections. Analyzer notes will include the "docs truncated" message and the "Django, Wagtail" framework detection with its shared reason. Finally, I'll list dependency files, configuration files, and documentation files, then write the complete content.
Right, back to the ONBOARDING.md.
