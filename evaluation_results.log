I will start by reading the instructions in `.gemini/B-prompt.txt` to understand the task.
Okay, I understand the instructions. I'll execute `analyze_repo` and `get_run_and_test_commands` first, then use their output to create and write the `ONBOARDING.md` file, following all formatting rules. Finally, I'll report token usage.
Okay, `analyze_repo` is done. Time for `get_run_and_test_commands`.
I will now generate `ONBOARDING.md`. I'll extract `repoPath` for the overview, then set up the environment, including Python version and a generic venv if necessary. Next, I'll prioritize `make install` for dependencies, otherwise using `pip install`. I'll list run, test, and lint/format commands, handling "No explicit commands detected" as needed. Finally, I'll include analyzer notes, dependency files, configuration files with descriptions, and useful docs, adhering strictly to all formatting rules and omitting provenance.
`ONBOARDING.md` is done. Token usage: unknown.
Based on the executed plan, the `ONBOARDING.md` file has been created.
Token usage: unknown

Okay, I'm ready. I will now read the `.gemini/B-prompt.txt` file to get started.
Okay, I understand. I'll execute `analyze_repo` and `get_run_and_test_commands` first, then generate the `ONBOARDING.md` file according to the specified rules.
Okay, `analyze_repo` and `get_run_and_test_commands` output is ready. I'll construct `ONBOARDING.md`: starting with required headers, then filling "Overview," "Environment setup" (including Python version and venv if needed), "Install dependencies" (prioritizing `make install`), "Run / develop locally," "Run tests," and "Lint / format" with relevant commands. Next, I'll add "Analyzer notes," "Dependency files detected," "Useful configuration files," and "Useful docs" sections, ensuring correct command formatting and omitting provenance. Finally, I'll use `write_onboarding` to save the file.

Got it. I'll read `.gemini/B-prompt.txt` for instructions.
Okay, first I'll run `analyze_repo` and `get_run_and_test_commands`. Then, I'll use their output to generate `ONBOARDING.md` according to the specified rules.
`analyze_repo` done. Now, `get_run_and_test_commands`.
Okay, I've gathered all the necessary data from `analyze_repo` and `get_run_and_test_commands`. My plan is to assemble the `ONBOARDING.md` content following the specified rules: starting with the mandatory header and repo path, then populating sections for environment setup, dependency installation, local development/run, testing, linting/formatting, analyzer notes, dependency files, configuration files, and documentation. I'll pay close attention to Python version hints, generic venv suggestions, and ensuring all relevant `pip install` commands are included without exceeding the one-`pip install -r` rule unless explicit `requirements.txt` files dictate otherwise. I'll also ensure commands are listed uniquely and descriptions are accurate. Finally, I'll use `write_onboarding` to save the generated markdown.
`ONBOARDING.md` is done. Token usage: unknown.
I have completed the task.
