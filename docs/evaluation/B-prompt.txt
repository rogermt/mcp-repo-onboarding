You are running the Phase 5 A/B evaluation for onboarding quality.

Use the `repo-onboarding` MCP server and follow the grounding rules strictly.

Hard rule: DO NOT inspect/read repository files directly in this run. Use only MCP tool output as evidence.

Step 1 — Call MCP tools:
1) Call `analyze_repo` with {}.
2) Call `get_run_and_test_commands` with {}.

Step 2 — Extract evidence (internal use only, do NOT include raw tool JSON in ONBOARDING.md):
From `analyze_repo`, extract these fields for grounding your prose:
- repoPath
- python.pythonVersionHints
- python.packageManagers
- python.dependencyFiles
- python.envSetupInstructions
- projectLayout
- scripts
- testSetup
- configurationFiles
- docs
- notes

From `get_run_and_test_commands`, extract:
- devCommands
- testCommands
- buildCommands

Step 3 — Grounding rules (hard rules):
- Python version: ONLY mention a specific version if `python.pythonVersionHints` contains it. If empty, write exactly: "No Python version pin detected."
- Commands: ONLY include commands that appear in:
  - `scripts.*`, or
  - `testSetup.commands`, or
  - `get_run_and_test_commands` arrays.
- If those arrays are empty for a section, state: "No explicit commands detected by the analyzer." Do not invent alternatives.
- Never present Makefile recipe internals as commands. Prefer stable `make <target>` style commands if present.
- Generic suggestions: If a command has `description: "Generic suggestion"` or `confidence: "heuristic"`, label it as "(Generic suggestion)" in the output. Keep to 1–2 bullets max.

Step 4 — Produce ONBOARDING.md (copy/pasteable):
Write a single Markdown document that MUST start with the following exact structure:

# ONBOARDING.md

## Overview
Repo path: <repoPath>

Then continue with these sections (always include the headings exactly as written):
- Environment setup
- Install dependencies
- Run / develop locally (if commands exist; otherwise state none detected)
- Run tests (if commands exist; otherwise state none detected)
- Lint / format (if commands exist; otherwise state none detected)
- Analyzer notes (include this section ONLY if `notes` is not empty; if empty or missing, omit the section entirely; if included, render notes verbatim as bullet points)

Then include three separate “files” sections grounded to the correct MCP fields (do not mix them):
- Dependency files detected (list only from `python.dependencyFiles[*].path`)
- Useful configuration files (list only from `configurationFiles[*].path`)
- Useful docs (list only from `docs[*].path`)

Important formatting rule:
- Do NOT use "Repository:" as a title or heading.
- Always use "## Overview" and "Repo path: <repoPath>" exactly as above.

Step 5 — Write file (interactive mode only):
If you are running interactively and file writing is supported, call `write_onboarding` with:
- path: "ONBOARDING.md"
- mode: "overwrite"
- createBackup: true
- content: (the ONBOARDING.md you just generated)

If you are running in headless mode and `write_onboarding` causes the run to halt, SKIP the tool call and only output the ONBOARDING.md content.

Step 6 — Token usage:
At the end of your response (outside the ONBOARDING.md), write: "Token usage: <value if available, else unknown>"

Now execute.
