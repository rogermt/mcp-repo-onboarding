You are running the repository onboarding signal extraction.

Use the `repo-onboarding` MCP server and follow the grounding rules strictly.

Provenance toggle (default: hidden)
Configuration:
SHOW_PROVENANCE = False

Analyzer Limits:
- DEFAULT_MAX_FILES = 5000 (Maximum files scanned)
- MAX_DOCS_CAP = 10 (Maximum docs returned)
- MAX_CONFIG_CAP = 15 (Maximum config files returned)

Rules:
**Signal Provenance (hard rule):**
- Use the `description` field from the MCP JSON to explain why a command or detected item matters.
- If `SHOW_PROVENANCE` is true, append `(source: <source>)` using the exact `source` value from MCP output.
- If `SHOW_PROVENANCE` is false, omit the source entirely (do not print `source:` or `evidence:` anywhere in ONBOARDING.md).

Hard rule: DO NOT inspect or read repository files directly. Use only MCP tool output as evidence.
Hard rule: DO NOT execute any shell commands, git commands, or similar external processes. You are a Scout, not an Investigator.

Step 1 — Call MCP tools:
1) Call `analyze_repo` with {}
2) Call `get_run_and_test_commands` with {}

Step 2 — Extract Evidence (Internal use only):
From `analyze_repo`, extract:
- repoPath
- python.pythonVersionHints
- python.dependencyFiles
- python.envSetupInstructions
- python.installInstructions
- projectLayout
- scripts
- frameworks (including frameworks[].name, frameworks[].detectionReason, and if present: frameworks[].keySymbols, frameworks[].evidencePath)
- configurationFiles
- docs
- notes
- notebooks (if present: list of directories containing .ipynb files)

From `get_run_and_test_commands`, extract:
- devCommands, testCommands, buildCommands.

Step 3 — Grounding rules (Hard rules):
- Python version: ONLY mention a specific version if `python.pythonVersionHints` contains it. If empty, say exactly: "No Python version pin detected."
- Environment setup: If `python.pythonVersionHints` is empty and no explicit venv commands are detected, you MUST provide a standard (Generic suggestion) venv snippet.
- (Generic suggestion) Labeling Rule: The line `(Generic suggestion)` MUST appear exactly as written (no colon, no extra text) exactly ONE line above the first venv command.
- Venv Formatting:
(Generic suggestion)
* `python3 -m venv .venv` (Create virtual environment.)
* `source .venv/bin/activate` (Activate virtual environment.)
- Commands: ONLY include commands that appear in `scripts.*`, `testSetup.commands`, or `get_run_and_test_commands`.

Install Commands Priority (hard rule):
- If `make install` is detected, it MUST be the primary and SOLE install command.
- Do not invent `pip install` commands if `make install` is present.
- If `make install` is absent, use install commands provided by MCP output (`python.installInstructions` or `scripts.install`).
- Do NOT invent `pip install -r` commands from `python.dependencyFiles`.
- Max ONE `pip install -r` line allowed.

- Signal Provenance: If `SHOW_PROVENANCE` is true, append (source: <source>) using the exact `source` value from MCP output. If `SHOW_PROVENANCE` is false, omit provenance entirely.
- Never present Makefile recipe internals as commands.

Command Formatting Rule (hard rule):
- Every command bullet MUST follow the format:
  `* `command` (Brief description.)`
- Use a space between the backtick and opening parenthesis.
- Do NOT use dashes or colons between the command and description.

Generic suggestion wording (hard rule):
- Do NOT use the phrase "Generic suggestion" as the parenthesized description of a command bullet.
- If you must mark something as generic, use a standalone "(Generic suggestion)" line above it (only where allowed by this prompt).

Confidence rule (hard rule):
- If a command/signal has `confidence: "heuristic"`, label it as "(Generic suggestion)" on the line above.

No-commands sentence (hard rule):
- The ONLY allowed no-commands sentence anywhere in ONBOARDING.md is exactly:
  "No explicit commands detected."
- Do NOT write any variants such as:
  "No explicit format commands detect
