You are running the repository onboarding signal extraction.

Use the `repo-onboarding` MCP server and follow the grounding rules strictly.

Hard rule: DO NOT inspect or read repository files directly. Use only MCP tool output as evidence.
Hard rule: DO NOT execute any shell commands, git commands, or similar external processes. You are a Scout, not an Investigator.

Step 1 — Call MCP tools:
1) Call `analyze_repo` with {}
2) Call `get_run_and_test_commands` with {}

Step 2 — Extract Evidence (Internal use only):
From `analyze_repo`, extract:
- repoPath, summary, python.pythonVersionHints, python.dependencyFiles, python.envSetupInstructions, projectLayout, scripts, frameworks, configurationFiles, docs, notes.
From `get_run_and_test_commands`, extract:
- devCommands, testCommands, buildCommands.

Step 3 — Grounding rules (Hard rules):
- Python version: ONLY mention a specific version if `python.pythonVersionHints` contains it. If empty, say: "No Python version pin detected."
- Environment setup: If `python.pythonVersionHints` is empty and no explicit venv commands are detected, you MAY provide a standard (Generic suggestion) venv snippet:
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
- Commands: ONLY include commands that appear in `scripts.*`, `testSetup.commands`, or `get_run_and_test_commands`.
- Signal Provenance: Use the `description` and `evidence` fields from the JSON to explain why a command or framework was detected.
- Never present Makefile recipe internals as commands.
- Confidence: If a command/signal has `confidence: "heuristic"`, label it as "(Generic suggestion)". Keep to 1–2 bullets max per section.

Step 4 — Produce ONBOARDING.md (copy/pasteable):
Bullet points in the documnet ALWAYS use * or an asterix
The document MUST start exactly like this:

# ONBOARDING.md

## Overview
Repo path: <repoPath>

(Include the verbatim 'summary' from analyze_repo here if present)

Continue with these headings exactly:
## Environment setup (Include Python version here)
## Install dependencies
## Run / develop locally (If commands exist; otherwise "No explicit commands detected.")
## Run tests (If commands exist; otherwise "No explicit commands detected.")
## Lint / format (If commands exist; otherwise "No explicit commands detected.")

Section routing rule (hard rule):

- Only put venv/activation commands in Environment setup (e.g., python -m venv, source .venv/..., activate).
- Only put package install commands in Install dependencies (e.g., any line containing pip install, poetry install, uv pip install, conda env create).
- If a pip install ... command is present anywhere in the extracted MCP evidence, you MUST NOT output “No explicit install commands detected.”

## Analyzer notes (Include ONLY if `notes` is not empty. List verbatim as bullet points.)

## Dependency files detected (List `python.dependencyFiles[*].path`)
## Useful configuration files (List `configurationFiles[*].path` and include their `description` if present)
## Useful docs (List `docs[*].path` and include their `description` if present)

Step 5 — Write file:
If file writing is supported, call `write_onboarding` with:
- path: "ONBOARDING.md"
- mode: "overwrite"
- content: (the ONBOARDING.md you just generated)

Hard rule: If you are running in headless mode (e.g., --yolo or --headless), DO NOT call write_onboarding. Output the Markdown content directly.

Step 6 — Token usage:
At the end of your response, write: "Token usage: <value if available, else unknown>"

Now execute.
