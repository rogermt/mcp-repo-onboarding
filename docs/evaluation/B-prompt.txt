You are running the repository onboarding signal extraction.

Use the `repo-onboarding` MCP server and follow the grounding rules strictly.

Provenance toggle (default: hidden)
Configuration:
SHOW_PROVENANCE = False

Analyzer Limits:
- DEFAULT_MAX_FILES = 5000 (Maximum files scanned)
- MAX_DOCS_CAP = 10 (Maximum docs returned)
- MAX_CONFIG_CAP = 15 (Maximum config files returned)

Rules:
**Signal Provenance (hard rule):**
- Use the `description` field from the MCP JSON to explain why a command or detected item matters.
- If `SHOW_PROVENANCE` is true, append `(source: <source>)` using the exact `source` value from MCP output.
- If `SHOW_PROVENANCE` is false, omit the source entirely (do not print `source:` or `evidence:` anywhere in ONBOARDING.md).

Hard rule: DO NOT inspect or read repository files directly. Use only MCP tool output as evidence.
Hard rule: DO NOT execute any shell commands, git commands, or similar external processes. You are a Scout, not an Investigator.

Step 1 — Call MCP tools:
1) Call `analyze_repo` with {}
2) Call `get_run_and_test_commands` with {}

Step 2 — Extract Evidence (Internal use only):
From `analyze_repo`, extract:
- repoPath
- python.pythonVersionHints
- python.dependencyFiles
- python.envSetupInstructions
- projectLayout
- scripts
- frameworks
- configurationFiles
- docs
- notes
- notebooks  (If present: list of directories containing .ipynb files)

From `get_run_and_test_commands`, extract:
- devCommands, testCommands, buildCommands.

Step 3 — Grounding rules (Hard rules):
- Python version: ONLY mention a specific version if `python.pythonVersionHints` contains it. If empty, say exactly: "No Python version pin detected."
- Environment setup: If `python.pythonVersionHints` is empty and no explicit venv commands are detected, you MUST provide a standard (Generic suggestion) venv snippet.
- (Generic suggestion) Labeling Rule: The line `(Generic suggestion)` MUST appear exactly as written (no colon, no extra text) exactly ONE line above the first venv command.
- Venv Formatting:
(Generic suggestion)
* `python3 -m venv .venv` (Create virtual environment.)
* `source .venv/bin/activate` (Activate virtual environment.)
- Commands: ONLY include commands that appear in `scripts.*`, `testSetup.commands`, or `get_run_and_test_commands`.
- Install Commands Priority: If `make install` is detected, it MUST be the primary and SOLE install command. Do not invent `pip install` commands if `make install` is present. If `make install` is absent, use the install commands provided by MCP output (`python.installInstructions` or `scripts.install`). Do NOT invent `pip install -r` commands from `python.dependencyFiles`. Max ONE `pip install -r` line allowed.
- Signal Provenance: If `SHOW_PROVENANCE` is true, append (source: <source>) using the exact `source` value from MCP output. If `SHOW_PROVENANCE` is false, omit provenance entirely.
- Never present Makefile recipe internals as commands.
- Command Formatting Rule (hard rule): Every command bullet MUST follow the format:
  `* `command` (Brief description.)`
  Use a space between the backtick and opening parenthesis.
  Do NOT use dashes or colons between the command and description.
- Confidence: If a command/signal has `confidence: "heuristic"`, label it as "(Generic suggestion)" on the line above.

Notebook-centric rule (informational only):
- If `notebooks` is present and non-empty OR notes include the notebook-centric message, add a bullet in `## Analyzer notes` indicating:
  "Notebook-centric repo detected; core logic may reside in Jupyter notebooks."
- Also include a bullet listing notebook directories, e.g.:
  "* Notebooks found in: notebooks/, research/"

Do NOT prescribe a runner (Kaggle/Colab/local). Do NOT assume notebook kernel language.

Step 4 — Produce ONBOARDING.md (copy/pasteable):
Bullet points in the document ALWAYS use `*`.

**Heading rule (hard rule):**
- Use the heading exactly: `## Environment setup` (do not write `## Environment` and do not add parentheses like `(Python 3.14)` in the heading).
- The first line under `## Environment setup` must be the Python version statement:
  - If `python.pythonVersionHints` is non-empty: `Python version: <value>`
  - If empty: `No Python version pin detected.` (DO NOT prefix with "Python version:").

The document MUST start exactly like this:

# ONBOARDING.md

## Overview
Repo path: <repoPath>

Continue with these headings exactly:
## Environment setup
## Install dependencies
## Run / develop locally
## Run tests
## Lint / format

Rules for empty command sections:
- If no commands exist for a section, write exactly: "No explicit commands detected."

Section routing rule (hard rule):
- Only put venv/activation commands in Environment setup.
- Only put package install commands in Install dependencies.
- If a `pip install ...` command is present anywhere in extracted MCP evidence, you MUST NOT output “No explicit install commands detected.”

## Analyzer notes
- Include ONLY if `notes` is not empty OR notebook-centric detection applies.
- List notes verbatim as bullet points.
- If notebook directories are available (analyze_repo.notebooks), add a bullet listing them (informational only).

## Dependency files detected
- List `python.dependencyFiles[*].path` as bullets.

## Useful configuration files
- List `configurationFiles[*].path` as bullets.
- If a `description` is present on a config file, include it in parentheses after the path.
- Do NOT print provenance unless SHOW_PROVENANCE is true.

## Useful docs
- List `docs[*].path` as bullets.
- (Do not invent descriptions for docs.)

Step 5 — Write file:
You MUST call `write_onboarding` to persist the changes:
- path: "ONBOARDING.md"
- mode: "overwrite"
- content: (the ONBOARDING.md you just generated)

Step 6 — Token usage:
At the end of your response, write: "Token usage: <value if available, else unknown>"

Now execute.
